# Sudoku-Solver
A program that will solve any sudoku problem. The sudoku board is stored in a list format - i.e each row is a list.In order to solve the problem, a backtracking algorithm is used. This is when the program will start at number 1, enter it and check if it is an acceptable solution. If it is not an acceptable solution it will try the next highest number i.e 2 and so on.If it is it will move to the next box in the row and try the same thing starting at number 2. and repeat the process. If it reaches a point where no possible number can be a solution, the program will backtrack to the previous box and change its value to the next possible number that works and moves back to the next box. If no new number can be entered in the backtracked box, the program will go to the next previous box until it can find an acceptable solution. Once solved the board with the completed solution will be printed.
